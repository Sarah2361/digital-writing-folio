# answers to questions 
1. What do you think digital writing is? 

[Any writing done on a screen, online. Anything electronically written. Not pen and paper. Can include online journaling, videos, images, audio and written works online.  

 

2. What do you expect from the digital writing lab? 

Something new and not seen before. Lots of digital poetry and fiction, with motion pictures. Developing my own motion pictures and onnline literature.  

 

 

3. What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)? 

I write mostly fiction. As a kid my writting was always written in third person with a narrator, before changing to first, however i now have more of a liking towards third person, as some of my favourite books are wrtten in thrid person and the depth that you can still go into third still amazes me and somehow makes the story more believable. In terms of non fiction, i have done and enjoyed some tasks, but its not really a genre i seek out as a first pick. In terms of poetry, even less than non fiction. I would like to get more into poetry, and build my confidence in that area.  

 

4. What tools (or techniques) do you use to write? 

 Ususally my wriitn is done throigh a word document (or google docs) as i like to be able to edit and restart and cut things out, whereas on pen and paper its near impossible to get things right on the first try, and as a perfectionist itâ€™s difficult. I try to include all the senses when i write, i like simils and metaphors, foreshadowing, chekovs gun are imporatnt things that i would like to work on. Illustration and imagery are other being wriitng techniques that i use, and very occasionally i try and make things rhyme (this usually happens more in poetry).]


# Reflection on first class 

<p> Never heard of GitHub or glitch before - or even interactive fiction. A lot of the coding stuff reminds me of a high school computer class - in terms of the coding. GitHub is going to have to be something i familiarise myself with more, but it's not the first time I've had to get to understand a completely new platform. The Glitch stuff was interesting, and I'm really interested to find out more about interactiev fiction anad how to create my own games and puzzles. I find interactive fiction cool as it consistantly keeps the reader engaged and they're able to decide what happens next in the story, which is such an interesting way for a story to be able to be told and unfold. It looks like somehting I could eeasily be obsessed with. The github account stuff was somehting i already set up beforee class for fear that i would be behind when i started, only to find out it was soemthign i didnt need to be so worrried about. Although i'd rather be in that position than the reverse </p>

# Reflection on Monday week 3 
<p>
1. What aspects of the remix are the same? 
exporting the document to my GitHub account. 

2. What aspects of the remix are different?
Different wording in the Haiku poem (Garfield). We did this through the index, java script and style. It was slightly difficult to follow along but I managed to figure out what we were doing and editing all the poems. I also editee the 'searching' part, with the dropdown box and the different options there. 

3. Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
The remix was succcessful, however I feel like there may have been some bits that I missed towards the end, as there was some difficulty exporting the file. Otherwise I would say the remix is successful as it made it to my GitHub acccount, and the changes had been made.

How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
I feel slightly more confident with coding - it actually feels slighlty nostalgic to when I was in year 9 computer classes and we learnt some coding stuff (not that I can remember a lot). However, I do still feel a bit out of my depth with coding, as the only form of writing I really did before was through a word/google doc or on paper. 

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways? 
Because I'd never even heard of the term 'e-lit' prior to starting this class, I didn't really have an opinion of it beforehand. I do enjoy the interactive stories, more so than the poems. I like having the different options and the different outcomes. I had also watched a poem as an option of the electronic literature collections and had never encountered anything like it before. </p>
